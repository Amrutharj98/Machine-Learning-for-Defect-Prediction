# Machine-Learning-for-Defect-Prediction
### Description:
Developed a machine learning model to predict the lifespan of metal parts based on manufacturing parameters. The goal was to estimate whether a part is defective or usable without destructive testing, helping optimize production processes.

### Key Tasks:
#### âœ” Regression Analysis: Predicted part lifespan using multiple ML models and evaluated performance.
#### âœ” Classification Model: Developed a model to classify parts as defective or non-defective based on a lifespan threshold.
#### âœ” Feature Engineering: Explored alternative methods (statistical thresholds, clustering) for better defect classification.

### Skills & Technologies:
ðŸ”¹ Machine Learning: Regression & Classification Models

ðŸ”¹ Data Analysis: Feature Engineering, Model Evaluation, Hyperparameter Tuning

ðŸ”¹ Tools: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
