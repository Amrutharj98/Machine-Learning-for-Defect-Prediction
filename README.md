# Machine-Learning-for-Defect-Prediction
### Description:
Developed a machine learning model to predict the lifespan of metal parts based on manufacturing parameters. The goal was to estimate whether a part is defective or usable without destructive testing, helping optimize production processes.

### Key Tasks:
#### âœ” Regression Analysis: Predicted part lifespan using multiple ML models and evaluated performance.
#### âœ” Classification Model: Developed a model to classify parts as defective or non-defective based on a lifespan threshold.
#### âœ” Feature Engineering: Explored alternative methods (statistical thresholds, clustering) for better defect classification.

### Skills & Technologies:
ðŸ”¹ Machine Learning: Regression & Classification Models

ðŸ”¹ Data Analysis: Feature Engineering, Model Evaluation, Hyperparameter Tuning

ðŸ”¹ Tools: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
### Dataset Description
This file contains 1000 observations of metal parts that have been destructively tested to estimate their true lifespan for if the part was used for its intended purpose. These lifespan measurements have been collected with processing parameters used when casting the parts, along with observations of the state of the microstructure and observable defects on the completed part.
